This plugin came about as a result of my desire to fully automate the creation
of my program documentation. 

First, I found, updated and enhanced a fork of the [Markdownj library][1], 
now my own [BEWSoftware MDj Core Library][2], then I developed a command-line
program to use it: [BEWSoftware MDj Cli][3].
